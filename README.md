# AutomaticKnots
Function that automatically calculates knots for Bezier curves. Using Euclidean distance between points and total path space, implemented in path planning. This study is based on https://gitlab.com/erehm/PiecewiseG1BezierFit

In the image below it is possible to observe the knots (close to the curve) and the control points that pass tangent to it, this graph does not show the calculation of automatic knots.

In the image below, we have the function being implemented and with that it is possible to notice greater smoothness and control of the curve.
